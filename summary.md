# What Philanthropic organizations should know about open science

Open science offers an opportunity for philanthropic organizations to maximize the impact of their funding both during and after grantee awards.  Here we offer a brief guide to open science practices in this context.

## Why open science?

Science advances by building on previous discoveries through the sharing of ideas and methods. Open science explicitly recognizes this by encouraging scientists to share ideas, methods, and data in ways that maximize the potential for future reuse.  By allowing all aspects of previous discoveries to be built on directly, this maximizes the impact of the research on the field.

Currently, many scientists do not publish the software or data that form the basis of their research, and choose to use licenses and publishing venues that do not permit broad reuse and remixing of publications.  This limits the impact of funding this research by slowing the pace of future discoveries based the future results. In recognition of this an increasing number of foundations have begun to require open practices for research they are funding.

## What do you mean by "open science practices"?

There are many implicit and explicit barriers to openly sharing research that can be overcome by encouraging or requiring a core set of practices.  These practices address issues such as ownership of publications, copyright and licensing of source code, and sharing of data.  These practices rarely conflict with commercialization or patent opportunities and coexist happily with traditional academic practices.  Moreover, institutional barriers to implementing these practices can often be overcome by placing a few simple requirements on funding.  These requirements don't need to have a negative impact on researchers - in fact, there is [strong evidence](https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e16800) that 
adopting open science practices can benefit researcher careers [4].

## Open Access and Preprints

Many philanthropic organizations and federal funders encourage their grantees to practice **Open Access**, in which publications are made freely available to the public immediately upon publication (e.g., Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Ford Foundation, Welcome Trust) or after an embargo period (e.g., NIH, NSF, NASA).  This can be done through the publisher (Gold Open Access), or through institutional repositories (Green Open Access). This guarantees that the results of the funded research can be widely read and that they can be used by data mining and machine learning experts to extract scientific facts and learn from the entirety of the scientific corpus.

**Preprints** are papers that are made publicly available prior to peer review or publication; preprints overcome the often long lag time between completing a scientific study and making the results broadly available.  This allows research be built on more rapidly. In some fields such as physics and math, preprints are common; in other fields such as biology, preprints are increasingly being adopted.  Most journals explicitly allow preprinting and some philanthropic organizations have begun to require the posting of preprints by their investigators (e.g., the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative [1])

Funders are in an excellent position to require open publication of the research their funding produces. We encourage philanthropic organizations to require that all publications be made openly available using [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) licenses (preferably CC-BY; the most liberal of these licenses) at the time of publication. The posting of preprints should be encouraged by including them as part of the grant reporting and proposal evaluation process, or by requiring that preprints be posted by the time the paper is initially submitted to a journal for review.

## Software and source code

Science increasingly rests on methods implemented in software applications, software libraries, and data analysis scripts.  Making the source code available for use, reuse, and modification, allows the methods to be widely used and rapidly built on. This involves making the source code publicly available and **licensing** it appropriately for reuse and further development. Open licensing allows software to be freely updated, remixed with other software, combined into larger pipelines, and packaged and distributed through tools that make software easier to install (e.g., many bioinformaticians install their software through debian and homebrew). Open licensing does not prohibit distribution of the software under another license or commercialization of the software. Open source software allows scientists from multiple groups to collaborate on important scientific infrastructure and allows that infrastructure to be maintained long after the initial developers loses interest.  Software that is not available under an open source license typically dies when funding lapses.

We recommend that funders require any software or code that is developed using their funding to be released under [OSI-approved free and open source software license](https://opensource.org/licenses). We also recommend that the code be archived in a location that guarantees that the software will be available for an extended period of time.

## Open data

Empirical science rests on the interpretation of data, and replication, re-analysis, and meta-analysis often depend on access to the original or raw data.  Data achieves its maximum impact when it is made broadly available through third-party archives that allow reuse, remixing, and redistribution; this is called "open data". Common open data practices include use of standard file formats, permitting automated download of complete data and metadata records, and liberal reuse and remixing policies under a open licenses.  Data that is not findable, accessible, interoperable, or reusable ([FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples)) is generally unavailable preventing: 1) other researchers analyzing the reanalyzing data; 2) the inclusion of the data into indexes for searching; and 3) reuse of the data in novel ways or in larger synthetic studies.  Data that is not publicly archived is often [lost entirely in less than a decade](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(13)01400-0) [3].

Some fields and journals have established cultures that require deposition of raw data into third-party archives upon publication; other fields are still developing their requirements.  However, studies of data reuse suggest that requiring deposition into third-party repositories significantly increases the likelihood that data can be discovered, accessed, and reused (@cite).

We recommend that funders require that data collected using their resources be make publicly available under open licenses or waivers. The [Creative Commons Public Domain Declaration](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) (CC0) is considered the gold standard for data sharing [2], relying on community norms rather than the license itself, to set the norms for attribution.
