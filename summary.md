# What we wish Philanthropic orgs knew about open science

Open science offers an opportunity for philanthropic organizations to maximize the impact of their funding both during and after grantee awards.  Here we offer a brief guide to open science practices.

## Why open science?

Science advances through the sharing of ideas and methods, and open science explicitly recognizes this by encouraging scientists to not only share ideas and methods and data broadly, but to maximize reuse and remixing of these ideas, methods, and data over time.  In turn, this maximizes the impact of the research on the field.

More practically, many scientists choose to use licenses and publishing venues that do not permit broad reuse and remixing of publications, data and software in the long term.  This limits the future utility of their research as well as the impact of funding them.

## What do you mean by "open science practices"?

There are many implicit and explicit barriers to sharing that can be overcome by encouraging or requiring a core set of practices.  These practices address issues such as ownership of publications, copyright and licensing of source code, and sharing of data.  These practices rarely conflict with commercialization or patent opportunities and coexist happily with traditional academic practices.  Moreover, institutional barriers to implementing these practices can often be overcome by placing a few simple requirements on funding.  These requirements don't need to have a negative impact on careers - in fact, there is [strong evidence](https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e16800) that 
adopting open science practices can benefit researcher careers directly.

## Open Access and Preprints

Many philanthropic organizations and federal funders encourage their grantees to practice **Green Open Access**, in which all publications are made freely available to the public immediately upon publication (see Gates Foundation).  This can be done through the publisher, or through institutional repositories.

**Preprints** are papers that are made publicly available prior to peer review or publication; preprints overcome the often long lag time that lies between completing a scientific study and making the results broadly available.  In some fields such as physics and math, preprints are common; in other fields such as biology, preprints are slowly being adopted.  Most journals explicitly allow preprinting.

**Impact:** In contrast to closed access manuscripts, manuscripts that
are deposited in open access archives and preprint servers can be used
by data mining and machine learning experts to extract scientific
facts and build ontologies, magnifying their long term utility to the
field.

## Software and source code

Science increasingly rests on methods implemented in software applications, software libraries, and data analysis scripts.  When the source code to these methods are broadly shared and made available for use, reuse, and remixing, the methods achieve their maximum utility.  This involves **licensing** the source code under one of the several OSI-approved free and open source software licenses (link).  Notably, this does not prohibit distribution of the software under another license or commercialization of the software.

**Impact:** Source code released under an open source license can be
freely updated, remixed with other software, combined into larger
pipelines, and packaged and distribute by other people; for example,
many bioinformaticians get their software through the debian and
homebrew projects, which can only work with open source packages.
More generally, open source software can be maintained long after the
initial evelopers loses interest.  Software that is not available under
an open source license typically dies when funding lapses.

## Open data

Empirical science rests on the interpretation of data, and replication, re-analysis, and meta-analysis often depend on access to the original or raw data.  Data can achieve its maximum impact when it is made broadly available through third-party archives and with liberal reuse policies; this is called "open data". Common open data practices include use of standard file formats, permitting automated download of complete data and metadata records, and liberal reuse and remixing policies under a Creative Commons license (typically CC-BY).

When should scientists share data? Some fields and journals have a culture that requires deposition of raw data into third-party archives upon publication; other fields are still developing their requirements.  However, studies of data reuse suggest that requiring deposition into third-party repositories significantly increases the likelihood that data can be discovered, accessed, and reused (cite).

(guidance on language)

**Impact:** Data that is not findable, accessible, interoperable, or
reusable
([FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples)) is
generally unavailable to researchers after publication.  For example,
researchers may not be able to re-analyze the data, the data may
not be able to be incorporated into indexes for searching, and/or the
data may not be reused later or incoporated into larger studies.  In
the worst case, data in a private archive may simply disappear at some
point.
